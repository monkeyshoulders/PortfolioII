        <p class="para-copy">At Ritz I get the opportunity to do a lot of things. We are a small group so this affords me the opportunity to stretch out creatively. In my tenure at Ritz I have had the opportunity to design sound for podcasts and commercials, do voice overs for local radio spots, and create ad campaigns for our customers as well as our sister company Crash Studios. </p>

        <p class="para-copy">Music is all about capturing the mood. When I am designing sound at Ritz it’s usually for something that already exist. I already have a good starting point with visuals and a script. I still ask plenty questions and do as much research as I can about the audience for the piece. You have to know your audience, without this you can drastically change the vibe of a piece of work.</p>

          <p class="para-copy ritz-copy">My most recent composition was for a car dealership in Arkansas. The commercial was a 30 second spot meant to air in the dealership as well as on the local networks in the market where the dealer is located. <br><br>
          The spot was already done and our digital wizard Melvin was looking for some music. He found some examples for the owner of the business but they just weren’t right. Melvin asked if I could design some music for the spot and sent my the commercial. He said the owner wanted country music like Keith Urban. Upon some research I found that the town was rural and mostly comprised of blue collar, hard working people. I started to play around with banjo tracks but it just didn’t feel right. I continued to watch the commercial over and over and decided to try some texas slide guitar riffs and there it was. I had found the sound that fit. I worked the track a little more and added and subtract instruments so the GM could have some options to pick from.

Will the director of crash was looking for some music for his two podcast that he was finalizing. The music needed to be upbeat and digital. I set out to find the exact sound that would represent these two podcast.<br><br>
          Crash cast is crash studios everything podcast that interviews our clients and local personalities of the queen city. While we went over several different variations of the music this was the final product.<br><br>

          Superfast podcast is a sixty second podcast where guest of crash cast are subjected to a lightning round of questions on all subjects. We decided to make the two music tracks different since they would be released within days of each other and we wanted to not have confusion. <br><br>

          <p class="para-copy">We are also in the process of beta testing multiple Google Ads for crash. Crash had their grand opening in September and driving as many eyes to the business is priority number one. I was asked to craft a campaign that would inform us where to spend our ad dollars for Crash. We needed to advertise ourselves as a multi-purpose studio. I decided to test a general ad about Crash and then one for each of our specialties; photography studio, video production, and podcasting.
          <br><br>
          I found that after 30 days that our photography ad is far outperforming the rest. I have set up Google Analytics for our website and next steps will be tuning our ad experience to drive Crashes business goals.

        <h3 class="heading-3 ritz-heading">Stakeholders</h3>
        <p class="para-copy ritz-copy">I think you have to enter a stakeholder meeting with a completely open mind. Sitting in front of me are people who don’t think like I do and while the brand image is important and marketing yourself is essential, there is no immediate paycheck attached to this job. I like to keep it simple and ask open ended questions. What is Ritz Marketing? What do we do well? What is the most important part of the website for you? I let them know that this is essentially our best marketing tool and the first impression the business will make on customers. What do you want Ritz Marketing to be? This is where I like to keep the focus. We do things well and we need to work on other things but we need to convey a sense of expertise and value to our users. I gained valuable insight from this meeting. I found out about business goals for the future that won’t be added to the site but can give creative the insight to see where we are headed and try to capture a sense of forward movement in the company.
        </p> <br>
        <p class="para-copy ritz-copy">I also surveyed the employees to find that most don’t use the site as a tool for promoting the business. Some haven’t been to the site in over a year. It is a source of embarrassment for some employees and they fully support the idea to redo this part of the business.</p>

          The whole point of going through this ordeal is to focus on our users. I sat down with the creative team and our creative director and hashed out some of our typical user loosely based on some of the clients that we service. We also made up some fictional potential clients and we also created a user based off of our interns that we hire on a semesterly basis.</p>
          <img src="assets/img/users.JPG" alt="">
          <p class="para-copy">
            We came up with 5 total with ages ranging from 20 to 63 years old. These are first drafts and we will revisit them when we do some storyboard exercises later.

          <img src="assets/img/mood.png" alt="Moodboard">I’m working with 3 graphic artist and a video/animations specialist on our creative team. I wanted to have a moodboard that they could upload to digitally. I decided to make one on Figma so that we all could collaborate. In our weekly standup agile meetings I suggested that they find some of the best work that we had done over the years. We have had things that we recognized for awards and others that were very successful for our customers. I also wanted them to create art based all of the research and data that we currently have so far in our process. I wanted them to keep it loose and not worry so much about does this fit on a web page. This is a huge advantage for us because these guys are talented and I wanted to leverage every advantage that we have so that we can set ourselves apart.
