        <p class="para-copy">I was given the opportunity to teach at Tech Talent South in April of 2018. I had some great teachers and mentors while learning development, and one of my long term goals was to? I had reservations but I knew that I needed to get over these fears and trust that my instructors had taught me well enough.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-3 ritz-copy" style="font-size: 5rem">TTS</h3>
          <p class="para-copy ritz-copy">My first class was Intro to web development and design. I found that teaching and talking about what I knew and was passionate about was easy. The class was four weeks long and we met twice a week and covered topics on HTML5, CSS, Javascript, responsive design, advanced CSS, and bootstrap. The class culminated with a project that where the students had to design and develop a website of their choosing. I learned so much teaching this class and was so proud of my students. I got the opportunity to teach this again this past September.

TTS was in a kind of bind, but I had done so well with the intro class that they wanted me to try my hand at teaching Ruby development. I knew the basics of Ruby and had done fullstack Javascript development. I had 6 weeks to prepare for Ruby and the Rails framework. This was a challenge but I quickly picked up more than enough to teach the class and actually build several applications. This was such a great experince for me to learn and then teach the material immediately. I had to really focus on how to learn something deeply and then teach it to brand new devlopers. The classes were awesome and I had some amazing experiences on this journey.

           I had the privledge to work with The Big Idea Group last Christmas. Big has only one developer and he is quite talented. I was hired to shadow him for a week and then fly solo for a week. My primary responsibility was to develop responsive emails and deploy them via the salesforce software. I would get the PSD files from the designers and slice the images. I then would drop the images into the template and change any text and background colors. This would have been easy if I had any experience with photoshop. I learned on the fly how to use photoshop and salesforce and a new code base and a filing system. The people at Big were so awesome and I learned so much. Here are some of the emails that I coded.
